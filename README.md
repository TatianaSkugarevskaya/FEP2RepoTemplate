[This study aims at comparing the effectiveness of the most widely used antipsychotic drugs in patients with first-episode psychotic disorders. This would potentially help bridge the evidence gap in current clinical guidelines where little clear evidence on effectiveness and relapse prevention is present.]

[The study is a part of the OHDSI Guideline-Driven Evidence 2025 initiative.]
